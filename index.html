  <!-- ABSTRACT -->

    <section id="abstract">
      <p>
        This specification defines a timing object and an associated API. The timing object is a local object that may be used by Web clients to ensure precisely timed execution. If multiple time-sensitive components take direction from the same timing object, their behaviour will be precisely coordinated in time. Crucially, this is also the case in distributed settings. A central motivation for the timing object is that it may be connected to an online timing resource. This way, the local timing object is a gateway to precisely timed operations, both in single-device as well as multi-device scenarios.

    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->


    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>
        Timing mechanisms allow operations to be executed at the correct time. The Web already has several mechanisms supporting timed operations, including <i>setTimeout</i>, <i>setInterval</i>, as well as controllers for media frameworks and animations. Unfortunately, these mechanisms are limited in scope, as they only apply to timed operations within a single web page. In contrast, a multi-device timing mechanism allows precisely timed operations across Web pages hosted by different devices. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/">W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group</a> has been formed with the goal of extending the Web with native support for precisely timed operation in the multi-device scenario, as well as providing a unifying model to which all frameworks for timed operation may integrate. The timing object is the central concept in this initiative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Synchronized playback of multi-device linear media is an important use-case for multi-device timing. However, multi-device timing has wide utility for a variety of timing related challenges, including distributed media control and remote control, distributed synchronization, distributed time-shifting, distibuted time-ordering and distributed recording (time-stamping). This way, multi-device timing has applicability in many application domains, including TV and radio (broadcast and IP-based), secondary device applications, online education, VodServices, scientific visualization, music etc.

        <h3>Linear composition</h3>
        <p>
          Multi-device timing has particular importance for multi-device, linear media, as it is key to distributed, time-sensitive playback. Here we express the motivation of the timing object specifically in the context of linear media. So, an important purpose of introducing the timing object into HTML is to enable <i>linear composition</i> in both single-device and multi-device linear media. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Linear composition is simply the idea that complex linear media could be built from simpler, independent linear components. This way, the classical benefits of composition as a design principle, i.e. flexibility, reusability, extensibility and mashup-ability, would fully apply to linear media. For example, in the single-device scenario, imagine a linear presentation made from HTML5 video, some timed meta-information, a SMIL component, a WebAnimation, a map with timed georeferenced data, and a timed Twitter widget. Or, in the multi-device scenario, imagine the same components distributed or duplicated across multiple devices. In both cases linear composition requires interoperability of heterogeneous linear components, through precisely coordinated, timed playback. Currently though there is weak support for linear composition, and a main reason for this is that timing control mechanisms are custom and internal to each framework. This central purpose of the timing object is thus to simplify interoperability by providing a common basis for timing control in linear media.
        </p>

        <p>
         For a more extensive introduction to linear composition, please consult paper "Multi-device Linear Composition on the Web; Enabling Multi-device Linear Media with timing object and Shared Motion" by Arntzen et.al. This paper is available on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/2015/05/08/linearcomposition/">W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group</a>.

      <section>
        <h3>Design goals and architecture</h3>

        <p>
          The design of the timing object has two main goals:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            provide a unifying API for timed operation, as a basis for interoperability between timed components. In particular, support integration with existing timed frameworks such as HTMLMediaElements, HTMLTrackElement, WebAnimation, WebAudio and SMIL. The API must support highly precise timing, and be expressive enough to support control primitives appropriate for a wide range of media types and applications.
          </li>
          <li> 
            encapsulate complexity of distributed time synchronization, thereby allowing integrating frameworks to be included in precisely timed multi-device operation. In particular, by providing the same API for local and online timing resources, timed components may be used in single-device and multi-device scenarios, without modification. 
          </li>
        </ol>


        <p>
          The figure below illustrates these functions, as well as the underlying client-server architecture. Three devices each have a single timing object, which are then individually connected to a single, shared online timing resource. Internally on each device, the timing object will act as the director for independent, time-sensitive GUI components. This way, a video will aim to present videoframes in accordance with the timing resource. Similarly, a time-sensitive Twitter widget might replay time-stamped Tweets. If the timing object pauses, the connected components are notified and react accordingly. Crucially, note how the different components can go about their business in complete isolation. There is no need for components to communicate, except indirectly through the timing object. This loose coupling is the key to linear compsability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, when timing objects are connected to an online timing resource, they will act as local representatives. For example, if a connected timing object is requested to pause, the request will simply be forwarded to the online timing object. As the online object pauses, notifications will be multicast to all connected clients. Finally, timing object will update their internal state and notify connected UI components. For online timing objects, clients can expect update latency of about one round trip time (TCP), whereas local timing resources should have no update latency. Apart from this, online and local timing resources should be hard to distinguish. Note also that the argument made for the independence of time-sensitive components in the single-device scenario now applies to the multi-device scenario as well. 
        </p>

        </figure>
   
        <p class="note">
          The protocol used to connect, synchronize and interact with online timing resources will be defined in a separate specification.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Similarly, the integration of the timing object with other frameworks for timed operation, such as HTML5 Media Elements, HTML5 Track Elements, Web Animation, SMIL, and Web Audio [[!HTML5]] will be covered separately.

      <section>
        <h3>The timing object</h3>
        <p>
          The timing object is conceptually a very simple object, essentially an advanced stop watch. If started, its value changes predictably in time, until at some point later, it is paused, or perhaps reset. It may be queried for its value at any time. For example, it should take exactly 2.0 seconds for the value to advance from 3.0 to 5.0 when the velocity is 1.0. Such deterministic behavior is required for reliable distributed synchronization. In terms of implementation, the timing object is a fairly thin wrapping around a monotonic system clock (integration with online timing resources adds a bit of complexity). The precision of the timing object is that of the monotonic system clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Importantly, the timing object is more expressive than the traditional stop watch. It supports any velocity or acceleration, and may jump to any position on the timeline. In fact, the timing object essentially implements linear motion along a unidimensional axis. An elegant implementation is provided by the concept of Media State Vectors [[MSV]], based on the classical equations of linear motion under constant acceleration. The timing object adopts this model. At any point in time, position, velocity or acceleration may be requested to change. Querying the timing object reveals not only its current value (position) but also its velocity and acceleration at that moment. This detailed information is again helpful in precise synchronization, and the expressiveness of the underlying mathematical model implies that a wide variety of control primitives may be supported. In particular, discrete jumps on the timeline may be used to control a slide show, whereas velocity corresponds to <code>playbackRate</code> for the control of continuous media. Acceleration is required by certain animation frameworks.

        <h3>Programming with timing objects</h3>

        <p>
          Timing objects are resources used by your application, and you may define as many as you like. What purposes they serve in the application is up to the programmer. If the application needs a shared, multi-device clock, just start a timing object and make sure you never stop it. If you want the clock value to represent milliseconds, just set the velocity to 1000 (advances the timing object with 1000 milliseconds per second). If the timing object represents media offset, just specify the playback position, the velocity, and perhaps a media duration. For video you might measure offset in seconds or frames and set the velocity accordingly. Or, for musical applications it may be practical to let the timing object represent beats per second. Note also that the timing object may represent time-changes with any kind of variable. For instance, if you have data that is organized according to, say height above sea level, you may want to animate how this data changes as you move vertically. In this case the timing object might represent meters or feet above sea level, and positive and negative velocities would allow you to move both upwards and downwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, the timing object is particularly useful when you have a variable that needs to change predictably in time.
        </p>
      </section>


      <section>
      	<h3>Media capture and playback</h3>

      	<p>
      		Two very common uses of the timing object include media capture and playback. For media playback, the  timing object may play the role of director/controls. Multiple independent components, possibly on different devices, may be responsible for timed presentation of timed media. If all components take direction from a single timing object, playback is ensured to be consistent.
  		</p>
  		<p>
      		For media capture, the timing object may represent a shared clock for timestamping various types of captured media, also in multi-devices scenarios. As long as timestamps are sampled from a shared clock and included in the captured media, time-shifted playback is possible. In live capturing scenarios, the timing object object should likely just run continuously like a clock, or perhaps be adjusted just slightly from time to time to stay in sync with some real-world clock source, e.g. epoch. However, media capture in a studio may be a much more iterative process, recording one track or sample at a time. In such scenarios, the timing object might have to be paused and rewind for each take. The timing object will then play the dual role of playback director for previously captured media, as well as production clock for current capture.  
      	</p>
      </section>

      <section>
      	<h3>Reference point in capture and playback</h3>

      	<p>
      		The concept of reference point refers to the exact time-alignment of timing object and media in capture and playback. Disagreement about the details of this alignment is a source of (small) synchronization errors. For this reason, a common definition of reference points for time alignment in capture and playback is helpful.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		For media capture, media timestamps should reflect the point in time when external, physical signals are received by sensors. I.e., ideally when photons hit the lense or when sound waves hit the microphone. So, as timestamping activity is delayed relative to this ideal reference point, timestamps picked from the timing object must be adjusted (upstream delay subtracted). This implies that capturing components must know (or figure out) their upstream latency. If all components are able to do this correctly, variation in processing delay will not produce synchronization errors.  
      	</p>
   		<p>
      		For media playback, media timestamps should reflect the point in time when timed media fragments take physical effect. I.e., ideally when pixels are modified on the screen, or when the loudspeaker modifies its vibration frequency. If playback commands are subject to non-negligible delay before they take effect, the playback component must schedule commands earlier. This implies that playback component must know (or figure out) their downstream delay. If all components are able to do this correctly, variation in processing delay will not produce synchronization errors.  
      	</p>
      	<p class="note">
          This definition of reference points is in accordance with definitions used in related standardization work, for instance see [[DVB-CSS]] / HbbTV2.0 CSS clause 5.7.2.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Strictly speaking, the timing object is usage-agnostic and can not mandate a specific definition for reference point. However, as interoperability of timing-sensitive components (e.g. capture and playback) is a major motivation for the timing object, the above definitions for reference point are recommended.

    <!-- USE CASES -->


    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Use cases and requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Precise timing has wide applicabilty in both single-device and multi-device applications. Here we identify some common use cases.
      </p>


      <section>
      <h3> Social Viewing and Media Control</h3>
      <p>
        Allow people to enjoy the same content at the same time. Alice and Bob would like to watch the next episode together, even if Alice is on a train and Bob stays at home. If Alice pauses the video while briefly speaking with the conductor, Bob's video pauses too. Alice and Bob may always trust the other to see the exact same thing, making it very easy for them to maintain a conversation, for instance by using a chat service or the phone. It would also be possible for Alice and Bob to split temporarily. Alice would see Bob moving along the progress line without her, and Bob would see Alice staying behind. When Alice is ready to resume viewing a bit later, she may continue on her own, play doublespeed or skip to catch up with Bob, or convice Bob to wait for her or jump back to see the segment again with her.      
      </p>
      <p>
        This use case is based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/New_Ideas">UC2-3 Identical Media Stream Synchronization</a>, a use case defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/">W3C Web and TV Interest Group</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This use case requires the management and sharing of multiple timing objects, at least one for Alice and one for Bob. Precision requirements for video synchronization are quite coarse as the use case is described. However, Alice and Bob might also choose to use this application in circumstances where they are sitting next to eachother, or they might hook their devices on to projectors in order to show a movie to a larger audience. Sub-framerate precision is required in order to avoid echo from device speakers. 
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3> Broadcasting - Time-consistent, Live Web Productions </h3>
      <p>
        The BBC provides live coverage of popular sport events such as the FIFA World Cup. Modern Web presentations of this kind tend to include many independent media streams. For example, there might be multiple video streams for different camera angles, visualizations of players on the field, player statistics, and there might be commentary from studio as well as viewers. Earlier, Bob was annoyed that user comments could sometimes ruin the experience by shouting "GOAL!" 20 seconds before the goal appeared in the video stream. However, after BBC started timeshifting live Web content to match distribution latency in their video backend, this problem seems to be a thing of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        This requires figuring out the estimated latency of the slowest distribution mechanism, and then to define a timing resource from which all parts of a presentation takes direction. In effect, early spoilers will be delayed (buffered) by the Web browsers and applied to UI components at the correct moment in time.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3> Broadcasting - Time-shifted, Live Web productions </h3>
      <p>
        A commercial media provider offers live Web content supplementing live broadcast of F1 races. Sometimes, as F1 races are held in different time zones, the provider will re-broadcast nightly races in the morning. As a keen F1 enthusiast, Alice is discontent that the Web content can not be time-shifted along with the re-broadcast of the race. So is Bob, the media provider's head of marketing, as he would like to sell time sensitive, Web-based ads for F1 races, and have the ads be presented correctly for both live and time-shifted broadcasts, as well as later on demand viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This requires timestamping of live Web production so that is may be time-shifted correctly and aligned with a time-shifted broadcast.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3> Broadcasting - Timed, Web-based Secondary Device </h3>
      <p>
        Alice opens the BBC Sport Web page on her iPad during the olympic games. The backend service consults Alice's profile and learns that she is already watching figure skating from the iPlayer on her laptop computer. As a result, the BBC Sports Web page is personalized with an offer to load BBC's Web-based extra material for figure skating. Alice accepts, and the iPad goes on to present stats, images, infographics, commentary and alternative camera angles, all precisely timed with the iPlayer. Alice notices that other viewers have already highlighted a Chinese athlete performing a bit earlier. She clicks to see it, and both the iPlayer (on the laptop) and the timed Web presentation (on the iPad) immediately skip back. After having seen the athlete's performance, now with added commentary provided by excited viewers, Alice contributes by giving it a thumbs up, and then clicks the back-to-live button. Both the laptop and the iPad snap back to presenting the live action.
      </p>
      <p>
        This use case is based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/New_Ideas">UC2-4 Related Media Stream Synchronization</a>, a use case defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/">W3C Web and TV Interest Group</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This use case requires managing personal timing resources for individual viewers, as well as a common timing resource representing the live clock. Both iPlayer and Web-based secondary device offerings must take direction from online timing resources, and allow dynamic switching of timing objects based on user input. Presenting alternative camera angles as part of secondary device offerings requires precise synchronization.   
      </p>

      <h3> Online Education - Timed, Multi-device Web Presentations </h3>
      <p>
        Alice teaches an online course for international students from across the globe. Every week she goes through a new Web-based slide set. Just before the session, she makes two links available for her students on the class Web page, links for the primary and the secondary view of the presentation. When the time is there she connects on an audio link and requests the first slide to be presented. Slides are presented on her view and on all the views of her connected students, at exactly the same time. This way, Alice can be sure that what she says on the audio link is always backed up with the correct illustrations. In effect, Alice remotely controls the Web browsers of all her students. Alice also has included a video in one of the slides. She plays the video for all the students on the primary view, while presenting some related bullet points on the secondary view. Alice pauses the video at a certain point in order to highlight an important aspect. Beforehand she has prepared some bookmarks in the video, allowing her to effectively skip to the interesting parts. At some point one of the students has a question related to the movie. Alice temporarily gives the student access to control the video, and the student rewinds it to explain the origin of his question. Afterwards, Alice withdraws the controls from the student and continues. The entire event is recorded and timestamped, allowing students that missed the class to replay the audio with and the slide presentation precisely as it was given. This review also provides synchronized presentations of timed comments provided by students as well as text-based search capabilities allowing efficient navigation within the presentation.         
      </p>
      <p>
        Multi-device slide show navigation requires a single shared timing resource, where position represents slide number. Videos require additional timing resources. Finally, timestamping of audio, slide navigation, video navigation, students commentary etc., require an addition timing resource as shared clock. Later individual replay might also require new timing resources.  
      </p>

      <section>
      <h3> Multi-Screen Data Visualization </h3>
      <p>
        Bob is heading a research project responsible for collecting and presenting a variety of data series related to climate changes in the Arctic. A Web-based approach to visualization makes for a very dynamic and extensible visualization system. Multiple screens may be used to present and align very different timed visualizations, making it easier to detect temporal patterns and possible correlations. The different visualizations may be navigated in unison. For instance, Bob may slow down the presentation speed for the heavy melting days to co-present this with measurements of salinity levels in the ocean water. Bob may also search his data to find the day with the highest temperature. By clicking on the result, all screens immediately display the relevant data for that day. Alice is recognized as an international expert in this area. Bob shares the link with Alice in an email, they may co-view the presentation even though they are stationed in different continents, and Alice may explore the visualization herself before giving her opinion of Bob's finding. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A shared timing resource is required to support playback of timed data streams on multiple screens. The utility is not limited to Web-based visualization. For instance, native visualization frameworks (e.g. 3D) may also interact with multi-device timing resources, thus enabling very different visualization systems to cooperate in presenting a common data model. 
      </p>

      <h3> Seamless Workflows </h3>
      <p>
        Bob is watching a Netflix show using Chromecast on the TV when Alice interrupts and demands access to the living room big screen for herself and her friends. Bob reluctantly agrees to finish the show in his bedroom. Though, before he gets up he opens Netflix on his iPad. Netflix, well aware that Bob is already actively watching something, defaults to presenting the exact same thing, in perfect synchrony with the TV. Ensured that the transition was smooth, Bob leaves for his bedroom while staring at his iPad.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use case requires online timing resources and content resources to be tied to login information. So, when an already logged in user enters a VoD service with a second device, the default action could be to resolve which show is already playing and what timing resource is being used, and then to set up the new view with the exact same resources.

      <h3> Alternative Soundtracks </h3>
      <p>
        Alice's Portuguese mother has a hearing deficiency, so as the two of them sit down to watch a movie together, Alice hooks her smart phone up with the Portuguese audio track and lets her mother adjust the sound volume. Any issues with lip-sync should be due to the dubbing, not the audio synchronization.
      </p>
      <p>
        This use case is based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/New_Ideas">UC2-6 Clean Audio</a>, a use case defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/">W3C Web and TV Interest Group</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This requires lip-synch precision between video and audio.

      <h3> Timing Interoperability between Independent Providers </h3>
      <p>
        Bob watches soccer. Unfortunately, the clueless commentator is constantly pissing him off as he clearly favours the other team. Bob turns to a dedicated Web radio channel for an alternative commentary. The new commentator is better, but he is out of sync. Bob chooses the <i>SyncWith</i> option in the radio channel Web page and selects his TV provider. After confirming his credentials, the radio channel Web page is able to connect to the same timing resource used by the TV provider, and the Web radio is immediately in sync with his TV.
      </p>
      <p>
        This use case requires media providers to give access to timing resources associated with a given user, also when that user is requesting access from an external service. Synchronization of audio and video requires lip-synch precision.

      <h3> Linear Content Adaptation </h3>
      <p>
        Bob is watching cricket, but he and Alice soon need to get in the car to start the long drive to visit Bob's parents. He would like to keep following the cricket game on his smart phone, but does not have the bandwidth nor the money to enjoy HD content. Instead, Bob selects the timed HTML option. The audio goes on undisturbed, but the HD video is immediately terminated and replaced with a light-weight, timed animation of the cricket field. Alice is behind the wheels, and Bob may continue to enjoy the cricket match through audio and full support from all the HTML-based extra information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Shared timing resources allow smooth and dynamic switching from HD to timed-based HTML.

        Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and terminate these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must", "should", "may", etc.) used in introducing the algorithm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant).

        A <dfn>timing resource</dfn> represents a point moving along an infinite axis. This motion is defined by the position, velocity and acceleration of the point at a specific moment in time, according to some clock. Essentially, a <a>timing resource</a> represents a linear motion in real time. A <a>timing resource</a> may either be an <dfn>internal timing resource</dfn> under the control of a <a>user agent</a> or an <dfn>external timing resource</dfn> under the control of a <a>timing resource provider</a>. In both cases, the actual <a>timing resource</a> may run locally or may be an <dfn>online timing resource</dfn> hosted somewhere in the cloud.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        A <a>user agent</a> may typically offer native implementations of <a title="timing object">timing objects</a>, especially when the protocol needed is not available to Web applications. For instance, the clock synchronization mechanism defined in DVB for companion screens and streams [[DVB CSS]] uses a UDP-based protocol. A <a>user agent</a> could perhaps expose a <code>DVBCSSTimingObject</code> interface to allow Web applications to connect to a companion screen that supports this protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <dfn>internal clock</dfn> is a monotonically increasing clock provided by the <a>user agent</a> (such as the one defined in [[HR-TIME]]).</li>
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        Should we simply mandate the use of [[HR-TIME]] for the <a>internal clock</a>? This would have the advantage of clearly defining a time origin and precision for timestamp values.

    <!-- TIMING OBJECT -->



    <section>
      <h2>Timing Object</h2>

      <p>
        A <dfn>timing object</dfn> is an object that exposes a <a>timing resource</a> represented by a <a>state vector</a> to a Web application.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>timing object</a> has a <dfn>state</dfn> that describes the state of the connection with the <a>timing resource</a>, and an <dfn>internal vector</dfn> that represents the initial conditions of the current motion. The <a>internal vector</a> is used by the <code>query()</code> operation to calculate a snapshot of the <a>state vector</a> at the current timestamp of the clock associated with the <a>timing object</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The <a>timing object</a> supports any motion that can be expressed in terms of a <a>state vector</a>. This means that a <a>timing object</a> is expressive enough to implement clocks, stop-watches and a variety of media controllers (at least the temporal aspects of media control).
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>timing object</a> can have a <dfn>range</dfn>, which is an <code><a>Interval</a></code> object and represents restrictions for the positions of the <a>state vector</a> and a <dfn>current interval timeout</dfn>, which points to a scheduled timeout when set.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>timing object</a> has a <dfn>list of timing text tracks</dfn>, which is the group of <a title="timing text track">timing text tracks</a> that use the <a>timing object</a> as sequencer (see <a href="#sequencer"></a>). The <a>list of timing text tracks</a> is sorted in the order <a title="timing text track">timing text tracks</a> are associated with the <a>timing object</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        @@Say that a <a>timing object</a> runs the <a>time marches on</a> algorithm when it is moving. If a new algorithm needs to be created (probably), call it the <dfn>sequencer marches on</dfn> algorithm.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a>timing object</a> can also have a <dfn>timing provider source</dfn>, which is a <code><a>TimingProvider</a></code> object that encapsulates the logic needed to represent an <a>external timing resource</a>, and a <dfn>last measured time value</dfn> that is the last timestamp value read from the <a>timing provider source</a> and is used to check the monotonicity of the clock exposed by the <a>timing provider source</a>. The <a>timing provider source</a> is initialized once and for all when the <a>timing object</a> is created.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>timing object</a> is associated with a clock which is maintained by the <a>timing resource provider</a> if the <a>timing object</a> has a <a>timing provider source</a>, or is the <a>internal clock</a>.

          Sends a request to the <a>timing resource</a> to have it update the motion based on the provided vector and return a <code>Promise</code> that the update was taken into account. The update supports null values for the provided vector's attributes. This provides a simple mechanism for tying movements together. The idea is to allow one aspect of the movement to be updated while preserving the others. For instance, <code>{position:null, velocity:value, acceleration:null}</code> means <i>update the velocity to the given value while preserving the current position and acceleration</i>.

      <dl title="enum TimingObjectState" class="idl">
        <dt>connecting</dt>

          </p>
          <p>
            When a <a>user agent</a> is required to <dfn>stop observing</dfn> an object, it MUST stop any monitoring that was running on that object in the background.

    <section>
      <h2>Timing Provider</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>timing provider object</dfn> is an object exposed by a <a>timing resource provider</a> that encapsulates whatever logic is necessary to associate a <a>timing object</a> with an <a>external timing resource</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This mechanism is designed to decouple the <a>user agent</a> from any particular <a>timing resource provider</a>. In particular, this means that the protocols and logic used to identify, create or destroy an <a>external timing resource</a>, synchronize clocks and propagate motion updates to connected clients are up to the <a>timing resource provider</a>. Similarly, a <a>timing resource provider</a> may require Web applications or users to authenticate themselves before they grant them access to a particular <a>timing resource</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, a Web application willing to use a particular <a>timing resource provider</a> needs to load the corresponding JavaScript library provided by this <a>timing resource provider</a>, create a <a>timing provider object</a> and pass that object to the <a>timing object</a> constructor.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a>timing provider object</a> implements the following interface:
      </p>

      <dl title="callback interface TimingProvider" class="idl">
        <dt>readonly attribute TimingStateVector vector</dt>
        <dd>The <a>internal vector</a> that represents the initial conditions of the current motion.</dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute TimingInterval range</dt>
        <dd>The <a>interval</a>, if any, that defines range restrictions for the position of the <a>timing resource</a>.</dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute DOMString readyState</dt>
        <dd>The state of the object.</dd>

        <dt>double now()</dt>
        <dd>Returns the number of seconds from some arbitrary time origin defined by the <a>timing resource provider</a> when the object is created to the occurrence of the call to the <code>now</code> method.</dd>

        <dt>Promise update()</dt>
        <dd>
          Sends a request to the <a>timing resource</a> to have it update the motion based on the provided vector and return a <code>Promise</code> that the update was taken into account. The update supports null values for the provided vector's attributes. This provides a simple mechanism for tying movements together. The idea is to allow one aspect of the movement to be updated while preserving the others. For instance, <code>{position:null, velocity:value, acceleration:null}</code> means <i>update the velocity to the given value while preserving the current position and acceleration</i>.

          <dl class="parameters">
            <dt>TimingStateVectorUpdate newVector</dt>
            <dd>The new vector.</dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>
      </dl>

        <h3>Procedures</h3>

        <section>
          <h3>Retrieve the current time</h3>
          <p>
            When the <code>now</code> method is invoked, the <a>timing resource provider</a> MUST return the number of seconds from some arbitrary time origin defined by the <a>timing resource provider</a> when the <a>timing provider object</a> is created to the occurrence of the call to the <code>now</code> method, as evaluated by some software clock maintained by the <a>timing resource provider</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The time values returned when calling the <code>now</code> method MUST be monotonically increasing.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <a>external timing resource</a> that the <a>timing provider object</a> represents is hosted online, the <a>timing resource provider</a> may typically want to adjust the software clock through periodic measurements of this clock's skew against the clock of the server that hosts the resource in order to synchronize these clocks. How that synchronization is performed is up to the <a>timing resource provider</a> (see <a href="#implementation-guidelines"></a>).
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Process an update operation</h3>
          <p>
            When the <code>update</code> method is invoked on a <a>timing provider object</a> <var>provider</var>, the <a>timing resource provider</a> MUST run the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Let <var>promise</var> be a new <code>Promise</code>.</li>

            <li>Run whatever logic is necessary to pass the update request to the <a>external timing resource</a> that <var>provider</var> represents and alter the motion conditions accordingly.</li>
            <li>If this logic succeeds, resolve <var>promise</var>. Otherwise reject <var>promise</var> with an error.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Report new conditions of the current motion</h3>
          <p>
            When the <a>timing resource provider</a> needs to report an update to the motion conditions (position, velocity or acceleration) of the <a>external timing resource</a> that a <code><a>TimingProvider</a></code> object encapsulates, it MUST set its <code>vector</code> property to a new <code><a>TimingStateVector</a></code> that represents the new conditions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Report a state change</h3>
          <p>
            When the <a>timing resource provider</a> needs to report a change of connection state with the <a>external timing resource</a> that a <code><a>TimingProvider</a></code> object encapsulates, it MUST set its <code>readyState</code> property to the new value.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Report an error</h3>
          <p>
            When the <a>timing resource provider</a> needs to report an unrecoverable error for a <code><a>TimingProvider</a></code> object, it MUST set its <code>error</code> property to the error and set its <code>readyState</code> property to <code>closed</code>.

      <h2>State Vector</h2>

      <p>
        A <dfn>state vector</dfn> represents the classical four-tuple <code>(position, velocity, acceleration, time)</code> associated with the mathematical description of linear motion under constant acceleration. A <a>state vector</a> is used to represent the motion of a <a>timing resource</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, the <a>internal vector</a> of a <a>timing object</a> is a <a>state vector</a>, the <code>query()</code> operation returns a <a>state vector</a> and the <code>update()</code> operation takes a <a>state vector</a> as parameter.
      </p>

      <p>A <a>State vector</a> implements the following interface:</p>

      <dl title="interface TimingStateVector" class="idl" data-merge="TimingStateVectorInit TimingStateVectorUpdate">
        <dt>Constructor()</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The constructor takes a dictionary argument, <var>vectorDict</var>, whose content is used to initialize the new <code>TimingStateVector</code> object. The <code>timestamp</code> attribute is required, other attributes are optional and will be replaced by <code>0.0</code> if not given.

      <h3>Associating media elements with a timing object</h3>
      <p class="note">
        If this specification progresses along the standardisation track, this section should be merged in a future version of [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        The procedures below are incomplete, some of them are described as updates to be made to procedures defined in [[!HTML5]], and some procedures are missing. The goal is to define a <a>timing object</a> as a <code><a>MediaController</a></code> without requiring the <a>report the controller state</a> part and with prose to convey the need for a <a>user agent</a> to keep trying to bring the <a>media element</a> up to speed with its <a>timing object</a> when it cannot follow the motion the <a>timing object</a> imposes. Before dwelving into details, the Multi-Device Timing Community Group welcomes feedback on the overall approach proposed here.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section specifies an extension of <a title="media element">media elements</a> that allows them to use a <a>timing object</a> as a <a>media timeline</a> source.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of a <a>media element</a>, a <a>timing object</a> may be viewed as a <code><a>MediaController</a></code> with one notable exception: when it is slaved to a <a>timing object</a>, a <a>media element</a> cannot pause a <a>timing object</a>, even if it becomes stall.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>media element</a> can have a <dfn>current timing source</dfn>, which is a <code><a>TimingObject</a></code>, that imposes the <a>media timeline</a> and associated clock that the <a>media element</a> uses.

            The <code>timingsrc</code> attribute on a <a>media element</a> MUST, on getting, return the <a>current timing source</a>, if any, or null otherwise. On setting, the <a>user agent</a> MUST run the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Let <var>m</var> be the <a>media element</a> in question.</li>

          <p>
            When a <a>media element</a> has a <a>current timing source</a>, its <a>effective playback rate</a> is the <code><a>TimingObject</a></code>'s <a>internal vector</a>'s velocity.

          <p class="note">
            The <code>playbackRate</code> attribute has no effect when the <a>media element</a> has a <a>current timing source</a>, the velocity of the <a>state vector</a> of the <a>current timing source</a> is used instead in that situation.

        <p>
          If an <a>online timing resource</a> is updated, effects must apply equally to all connected <a title="timing object">timing objects</a> as quickly as possible, including to the <a>timing object</a> on which the update request might have been issued. This has implications for the processing of update requests. Local timing objects should simply forward the request (i.e. the <a>state vector</a>) across the network to the <a>online timing resource</a>, where the request will be processed. Effects (i.e. the new <a>state vector</a>) will be multicast by the <a>online timing resource</a> to all connected <a title="timing object">timing objects</a>, finally triggering a <code>change</code> event on these objects. Queries are always resolved locally, using the last <a>state vector</a> received from the server.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that this strategy does not guarantee that <a title="timing object">timing objects</a> receive the update notification at exactly the same time. It is possible to mask the differences in network latency by introducing an additional delay, but note that this might hurt the user experience.

        <h3>Clock synchronization</h3>
        <p>
          Ideally, if multiple <a title="timing object">timing objects</a> that represent the same <a>online timing resource</a> are queried at the exact same moment, they should return the same <a>state vector</a> (same position, velocity and acceleration). This requires that the local clock associated with the <a>timing object</a> be synchronized with that of the <a>online timing resource</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As synchronized system clocks is not a valid assumption in the Web environment, it follows that clock synchronization must be resolved as part of the communication between <a title="timing object">timing objects</a> and the <a>online timing resource</a>. To do this, <a title="timing object">timing objects</a> should maintain a software clock that is continuously synchronized with the system clock of the <a>online timing resource</a>. This may be achieved through periodic exchange with the <a>online timing resource</a> to evaluate the clock skew, taking into account the round-trip time (RTT) of these exchanges to improve the measurements. Using this evaluation, <a title="timing object">timing objects</a> can tranform <a title="state vector">state vectors</a> with respect to their own local clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clock synchronization can be very fast. Stable estimates may be reached within fractions of a second. Implementations may for instance use an open Web sockets [[WEBSOCKETS]] connection to minimize the latency between <a title="timing object">timing objects</a> and the <a>online timing resource</a>. If implemented correctly on both ends, this approach provides a basis to achieve &lt; 10ms media synchronization across the Internet.
